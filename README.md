![Test and Release](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.coronavirus-statistics/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)   
**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer.** More details see below!

Detailed analysis of your Energy, gas and liquid consumptions
Any source (kWh, Wh, Watt, l/h or m3 )can be used for data analyses :

## Features

#### Basic features
| state | functionality | Description |
|--|--|--|
| >device<.cumulativeReading |  [accumulate values](#cumulativeReading) | Calculate cumulated values <br/> including [transformation](#valueTransformation) <br/>cumulated value can be change by following [these steps](#cumulativeReading-Reset) |
| >Device<.>Year<.>Year statistics< | [Yearly statistics](#Year-Statistics) | Store statistic information of the Year at level <br/> >device.>thisYear<.>selected period< |
| >Device<.>Year<.>currentYear | [Current Year statistics](#Current-Period)  | Store statistic information of the current Year at level <br/> >device.>currentYear<.>selected period< |
| >Year<.>currentYear.>Consumption type < | [Consumption](#consumptionCalculation) | Root folder to store consumption data <br/> (current value - previous value). <br/> Can be consumption or delivery |
| >Year<.>currentYear.>Cost type < | [Costs](#costCalculation) | Root folder to store cost data. <br/> current value * cost + basic price <br/> Can be consumption or delivery |

All state locations are grouped by state name and separated in period and [Category](#Categories) structures. <br/> 
Calculations will be automatically handled and values transformed to the proper unit  as defined in [Price-Definitions](#Price-DefinitionsPrice-Definitions).

## How-To

### State-Activation!  ![Main Settings](admin/readmeDocu/settingKey.png)
![Main Settings](admin/readmeDocu/stateSettings.png)

| Configuration Item | Description |
|--|--|
| enabled | Activate state for SourceAnalytix | 
| Alias | default: name of state, Name of device as shown in SA|
| Select Type | mandatory, choose you calculation type to calculate according [Price-Definitions](#Price-Definitions) |
| Select Unit | default: automatically, choose manually if needed (see logs) |
| Costs       | Cost calculation |
| with(out) basic charge  | incl;ude basic charge in cost calculation |
| consumption | calculate consumption data |
| counter values | store current counter values |
| Meter reading at </br> 
  beginning of x : | Start value of counter for specific period to handle </br> calculation current - startValue|

### Price-Definitions

#### cumulativeReading-Reset
![Main Settings](admin/readmeDocu/cumulativeReading-Reset.png)

    **Stop** Sourceanalytix !
    Go to Admin > Objects
    Enter expert mode
    Find the related cumulativeReading for your device
    Adjust the value to your needs
    (Only writable if expert mode on)

#### cumulativeReading
> ToDo : Describe logic<

#### consumptionCalculation
> ToDo : Describe logic<

#### costCalculation
> ToDo : Describe logic<
 
#### valueTransformation
> ToDo : Document link to library (document lib also !)<br/>
> ToDo : Document watt to kWh transformation<br/>
> ToDo : Document unit transformation (like Watt, to Wh to KWh<br/>   

#### Year-Statistics
Store statistic information of consumption/prices and/or costs/earnings at the Year level <br/> 
> >device.>thisYear<.>cathegory<.>selected period

This information is typically used for data storage and historical comparisons. <br/>
States are grouped by specified period
(like year 2020 vs 2021, ore february 2019 vs february ect)

>#### *Weeks* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings <br/> 
> consumption/delivery<.weeks.**weekNr**<
>#### *Months* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings <br/> 
> consumption/delivery<.months.**Month**<
>#### *Quarters* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings <br/> 
> consumption/delivery<.quarters.**Qx**<

#### Current-Period
Store statistic information of the current Year at level :
>device.>currentYear<.>selected period

>#### *Weeks* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings <br/> 
> consumption/delivery<.weeks.**weekNr**<
>#### *Months* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings <br/> 
> consumption/delivery<.months.**Month**<
>#### *Quarters* <br/>
  >Device<.>Year<.>costs/earnings 
  > consumption/delivery<.quarters.**Qx**<

This information is typically used for daily/weekly/monthly calculation of <br/> 
costs/earnings and/or consumption/delivery grouped by specified period

>ToDo : Add screenshots<

#### Categories
| category | type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| costs | financial | Result of calculation value * cost price + basic price |
| earnings | financial | Result of calculation value * earning price + basic price |
| consumption | calculations | Result of calculation value as cost - start value <br/>  of Year/Month/Quarter  etc |
| delivery | calculations | Result of calculation value as delivery - start value <br/>  of Year/Month/Quarter  etc |


<!--

This adapter has is roots with thanks to pix back in 2016 
https://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2262

Which has been improved by @hadering and published on github
https://github.com/hdering/homematic_verbrauchszaehler

## To-Do
* [ ] Documentation!
* [ ] Period calculation selectable but not yet implemented
* [ ] monthly cost price not yet implemented in calculation
* [ ] recalculation based on meter values (configurable by date)
* [ ] add object states for previous [x]day, [x]week, [x]month, [x]quarter, [x]year configurable in adapter settings

## What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company?
Sentry.io is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
