![Test and Release](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.coronavirus-statistics/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)   
**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer.** More details see below!

Detailed analysis of your Energy, gas and liquid consumptions
Any source (kWh, Wh, Watt, l/h or m3 )can be used for data analyses :

* Trace consumption daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
* calculate costs (current price is configurable)
* Can be used for Power Consumption, liquids, and GAS
* Input values can be wh/kWh/Watt/m3/l

## How-To

Please provide your feedback here https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/31932/major-update-sourceanalytix-0-4-0-complete-code-rebuild

This adapter has is roots with thanks to pix back in 2016 
https://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2262

Which has been improved by @hadering and published on github
https://github.com/hdering/homematic_verbrauchszaehler

## Known issues
* [ ] Source Values reset to default value at night if default value is defined in an object (bug in JS-Controller, fix needed in 2.3)
*Workaround : Ensure no default value is set for self-created states*

## To-Do
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Period calculation selectable but not yet implemented
* [ ] monthly cost price not yet implemented in calculation
* [ ] recalculation based on meter values (configurable by date)
* [ ] add object states for previous [x]day, [x]week, [x]month, [x]quarter, [x]year configurable in adapter settings

## What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company?
Sentry.io is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
